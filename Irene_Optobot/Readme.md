# Project

In this project, flies were recorded in the optobot chambers and their behavior was analyzed using DeepLabCut. There are several groups:
* Control flies : flies that only carry the driver or the UAS
* PD flies : flies taht carry the driver and UAS and develop Parkinson's disease - like symptoms
* PD flies with SynjRQ : Flies that express the 'rescue' factor

# Analysis

The data was then analyzed to extract the classic features measured for Parkinson's disease in flies, such as speed, distance traveled, and the number of times the flies stop.
