# Tracking_Analysis
This repository contains processing, analysis and plotting scripts used for the research projects of Matthias Durrieu. The repository is organised as follows:

## Ball Pushing
Object affordance project using the Optobot and the Multimaze recorder to explore flies ability to push balls. In each subdirectory, associated processing and analysis scripts can be found.


### Optobot

Processing scripts include opencv based ball tracking algorithms and corridors cropping methods.

Analysis scripts include ball trajectory analysis, which use tracked ball position to reveal pushing dynamics and 'replacing' events where the experimenter replace the ball at initial position using a magnet.

### MazeRecorder

Processing scripts include
